In the dynamic realm of software development, my transition from a novice intern to a seasoned open-source contributor has been both challenging and rewarding. The open-source community provided an invaluable platform to sharpen my skills, collaborate with other developers, and make meaningful contributions. Here's a glimpse into my journey, as I navigated through obstacles, sought guidance, and eventually emerged as a successful contributor.

## Week 1: Taking the First Steps

In the first week of my internship, everything seemed straightforward and welcoming, serving as a gentle introduction to open-source collaboration. Taking my first steps was a pivotal moment, marking my entry into the world of open-source.

## Week 2: Facing Challenges and Seeking Clarity

As the second week progressed, I encountered challenges—deciding what to contribute and understanding the process. During moments of uncertainty, I sought guidance, finding clarity in Tublian's Week 2 call. This experience reinforced the importance of seeking mentorship and keeping an open mind.

## Weeks 3 & 4: Finding My Fit

With a clearer understanding, I began identifying repositories that aligned with my skills and interests. After much exploration, I selected the Dotnet repository as my focus, a decision that marked a significant milestone in my internship.

## My Contributions and Achievements

Throughout my internship, I made several meaningful contributions, with four pull requests successfully merged. These ranged from initial contributions to more complex projects, including:

1. **My First Contributions**
2. **Caddy Documentation in FreshRSS Repo**
3. **Dotnet Documentation**
4. **Bug Fix in Dotnet's DocFX**

### Completing the Tublian Internship Early

I was honored to be the first intern to complete the Tublian internship. This achievement allowed me to host a webinar titled **"How to Complete Your Tublian Internship,"** where I shared tips, strategies, and personal insights to inspire and guide other interns. The webinar underscored Tublian's culture of learning, growth, and collaboration, helping others on their journey toward open-source contributions.

## Key Learnings and Insights

Reflecting on my internship, here are a few takeaways that may benefit other aspiring contributors:

- **Exploration and Prioritization**: Explore projects aligned with your skills and interests. Start with issues labeled "good first issues" to ease into the contribution process.
- **Communication and Collaboration**: Engaging with project maintainers for guidance is crucial. Discuss insights, propose solutions, and submit detailed pull requests.
- **Persistence and Learning**: Embrace challenges as learning opportunities. Resources like Tublian's AI Copilot offer instant guidance, helping to overcome roadblocks.

## Conclusion

My journey from intern to open-source contributor is a testament to the transformative power of dedication and community support. Through resilience, collaboration, and a commitment to growth, I overcame challenges and contributed meaningfully to projects. For anyone aspiring to contribute to open-source, remember that the journey begins with a single step. With perseverance, the possibilities are endless—embrace the challenges, seek mentorship, and let your contributions shine in the vibrant world of open-source development.
