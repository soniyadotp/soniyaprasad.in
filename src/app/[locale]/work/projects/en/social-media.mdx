## Overview

The Twitter Clone project is a full-featured social media platform focused on high performance and scalability. Built using Next.js, TailwindCSS, and GraphQL, this project demonstrates efficient handling of large data sets and caching mechanisms to improve response times and user experience.

## Key Features

- **Optimized API Performance**: Enhanced API response times by 30% through efficient GraphQL query optimizations.
- **Database Management**: Leveraged Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL to handle over 10,000 records, resulting in a 20% reduction in query times.
- **Caching with Redis**: Implemented Redis for server-side caching, achieving a 60% improvement in performance and fault tolerance.

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js**: For building a fast, server-rendered front end.
- **TailwindCSS**: Provides a modern and responsive styling framework.
- **GraphQL**: Enables efficient data querying and reduces API response time.
- **Prisma ORM**: Manages data with PostgreSQL, ensuring efficient database interactions.
- **Redis**: Used for caching, enhancing performance and reliability.

## Challenges and Learnings

Integrating Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL required careful schema design to ensure scalability, especially under high data volumes. Additionally, managing server-side caching with Redis posed unique challenges, particularly in maintaining cache validity. These experiences reinforced the importance of optimized queries and caching strategies for high-performance applications.

## Outcome

The Twitter Clone successfully handles large data volumes and provides a smooth user experience through efficient API performance and caching strategies. This project showcases the potential of modern web technologies in building scalable social media platforms.
